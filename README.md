A project is contained, in a logical sense and in the file system, within a solution, which may contain one or more related projects, along with build information, Visual Studio window settings, and any miscellaneous files that aren't associated with a particular project. A solution is described by a text file (.sln) with its own unique format; it is generally not intended to be edited by hand.
